👋 Hi, I’m Anish Ghimire (@TechExplorerAnish)

🎓 I’m a Computer Engineering student who enjoys learning by building real-world projects and exploring how software can solve practical problems.

💻 I primarily work in **full-stack web development**, with hands-on experience in the **MERN stack** and **Next.js**, focusing on writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

🧠 Alongside web development, I’m currently studying and strengthening my skills in **Machine Learning**, with a growing interest in data-driven and intelligent applications.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools I work with:
- **Web:** React, Next.js, Node.js, Express, MongoDB  
- **Programming:** C, C++, Python, JavaScript  
- **Tools & Platforms:** Git, GitHub, Docker, Vercel  
- **Systems:** Linux / Unix (daily user)


🌱 Currently focused on:
- Improving full-stack and backend architecture skills  
- Strengthening Machine Learning fundamentals  
- Writing production-ready and efficient code  

🤝 I’m open to collaborating on:
- Web and full-stack applications  
- Machine learning or data-related projects  
- Hackathons and open-source contributions
